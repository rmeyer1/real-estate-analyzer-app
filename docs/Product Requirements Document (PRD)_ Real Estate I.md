## Product Requirements Document (PRD): Real Estate Investment Analysis Web Application

**Product Name:** Real Estate Investment Analysis Platform
**Stakeholders:** Real estate investors, asset managers, acquisition analysts
**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Team]
**Date:** May 31, 2025

---

### 1. **Purpose**

Transform a complex Excel-based real estate investment model into a robust, interactive web application that enables users to analyze, compare, and manage multifamily acquisition scenarios, cash flows, and rent rolls for a 160-unit property. The platform will replicate and enhance all financial calculations, scenario modeling, and reporting currently performed in the spreadsheet, providing improved accessibility, collaboration, and user experience[^1].

---

### 2. **Background \& Context**

The current Excel model is used for underwriting multifamily property acquisitions, including scenario analysis, cash flow projections, rent roll management, and return calculations. The spreadsheet contains macros for dynamic calculations and scenario switching. However, Excel's limitations in collaboration, data integrity, and accessibility necessitate a web-based solution[^1].

---

### 3. **Objectives \& Goals**

- Replicate all analytical capabilities of the Excel model in a web interface
- Enable dynamic scenario modeling and real-time recalculation
- Improve data visualization and reporting
- Facilitate secure, multi-user collaboration and data sharing
- Ensure all calculations match or exceed Excel’s accuracy and transparency

---

### 4. **Key Features \& Requirements**

#### 4.1. **Scenario Modeling**

- Users can define and switch between multiple acquisition scenarios (e.g., purchase price, loan amount, LTV)
- Real-time recalculation of returns (IRR, cash-on-cash, cap rates) as assumptions are edited
- Side-by-side scenario comparison dashboard[^1]


#### 4.2. **Cash Flow Projections**

- 7-year pro forma with monthly and annual breakdowns
- Income modeling with customizable rent growth, vacancy, concessions, and bad debt assumptions
- Expense modeling with inflation factors and management fee calculations
- Debt service module supporting interest-only and amortizing periods
- Automated exit value and net proceeds calculations[^1]


#### 4.3. **Rent Roll Management**

- Import, view, and edit detailed unit-level rent roll data
- Track occupancy, lease terms, market vs. in-place rent, and loss-to-lease
- Aggregate rent roll summary by unit type and status[^1]


#### 4.4. **Historical \& Pro Forma Analysis**

- Upload and analyze trailing 12-month operating statements
- Validate pro forma assumptions against historical performance
- Per-unit and per-square-foot performance metrics[^1]


#### 4.5. **Debt Amortization Schedule**

- Generate full amortization tables for custom loan terms
- Support for interest-only periods and principal paydown tracking
- Visualize outstanding loan balances over time[^1]


#### 4.6. **Reporting \& Visualization**

- Interactive charts for cash flow, returns, and rent roll metrics
- Exportable reports (PDF, Excel) for presentations and investment memos
- Customizable dashboards for key performance indicators


#### 4.7. **User Experience \& Accessibility**

- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Intuitive navigation reflecting the structure of the original Excel model
- Secure user authentication and role-based access control


#### 4.8. **Collaboration \& Data Integrity**

- Multi-user access with change tracking
- Version control for scenario and model updates
- Audit log for key actions

---

### 5. **Technical Requirements**

- **Frontend:** Modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue)
- **Backend:** Scalable API (e.g., Node.js, Python) with robust calculation engine
- **Database:** Relational database for property, scenario, and rent roll data
- **Security:** Encrypted data at rest and in transit; user authentication
- **Integration:** Ability to import/export Excel files for legacy compatibility

---

### 6. **Acceptance Criteria**

- All core calculations (returns, cash flows, rent roll summaries) match the original Excel outputs within a 0.1% margin[^1]
- Users can create, edit, and compare at least three acquisition scenarios
- Platform supports upload and parsing of historical rent roll and operating data
- Reports and dashboards are exportable and visually clear
- System supports at least 50 concurrent users without performance degradation

---

### 7. **Out of Scope**

- Automated property valuation sourcing from third-party APIs (future phase)
- Direct integration with property management systems (future phase)

---

### 8. **Milestones \& Timeline**

- **MVP Delivery:** Replicate Excel’s scenario modeling, cash flow, and rent roll features
- **Phase 2:** Advanced reporting, collaboration, and integrations

---

### 9. **Risks \& Dependencies**

- Ensuring calculation parity with legacy Excel model
- Data migration and import accuracy
- User adoption and training

---

### 10. **Appendix: Reference Model Structure**

- Description: Property and scenario summary, key returns
- Projection: Detailed cash flows and assumptions
- Trailing-12 \& Pro Forma: Historical and projected operating statements
- Rent Roll Summary \& Analysis: Unit-level and aggregate rent data
- Amortization Schedule: Loan payment and balance tracking[^1]
